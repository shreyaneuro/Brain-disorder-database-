# # Neurodisease Database

## Overview
The Neurodisease Database is an ongoing project aimed at organizing key information related to major neurological and neurodegenerative disorders in a structured format. The project focuses on understanding disease mechanisms, symptoms, and affected brain regions.

## Objective
- To compile structured information on neurological disorders
- To support learning about disease mechanisms and brain pathology
- To explore how biological data can be organized for neuroscience research

## Content Includes
- Disease name and classification
- Affected brain regions
- Key molecular or cellular mechanisms
- Common clinical features (high-level)

## Approach
- Manual data collection from textbooks and review articles
- Organization of data into structured tables
- Focus on clarity and biological relevance rather than completeness

## Current Status
🟡 In progress  
Data collection and structuring are ongoing.

## What I Learned
- How neurological diseases are classified
- The importance of structured data in neuroscience research
- Improved skills in organizing and curating biological information

## Future Scope
- Expansion to include more disorders
- Linking molecular mechanisms with clinical features
- Exploring basic database or visualization tools
